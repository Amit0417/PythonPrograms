'''Bank Account Manager
Under the Classes section in the list of suggested final capstone projects is a Bank Account Manager program.
The goal is to create a class called Account which will be an abstract class for three other classes called
CheckingAccount, SavingsAccount and BusinessAccount.
Then you should manage credits and debits from these accounts through an ATM style program.'''
